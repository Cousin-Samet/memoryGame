## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Description

This project is a memory game where the player has to click on cards to flip them. 2 cards can be flipped at a time and checked to see if they match.

If they do match the they stay open and the game continues.

If they don't match they will flip back over and the game continues.

Once all cards are matched the game will end and a modal will pop up with a final score showing the moves, time taken and the rating showed as stars.
